name: bdr-write
description: Use when a product or business call gets made - "we're charging per seat, not per user", "we're not supporting self-hosting", "this launches to the agency segment first", "we decided to drop the free tier". Drafts the record from what you say plus the product frame and discovery notes, then asks what neither can answer.

# bdr-write

A business or product decision was made. This writes the record **with** the user - they say
what was decided and roughly why, the agent drafts, they correct.

## Is it a BDR?

Ask who would overrule it. **A product owner means BDR; an architect means ADR** and
`adr-write` is the skill. If both would, the BDR is the parent and the ADR references it -
"we charge per seat" is the decision, "we model seats in the licences table" is its
technical consequence, and conflating them is how a pricing change later reads as a schema
change.

Say which way you routed, in one line.

## What a BDR wants - and why the questions differ from an ADR's

An ADR asks about forces and options. A business decision has those too, but the parts that
decide whether it was a good one are different, and asking an ADR's questions produces a BDR
that reads like an ADR with the wrong nouns.

- **Who it serves - by name from `docs/personas.md`.** Which persona is better off, and which
  one is not. A decision that serves everyone equally is usually one nobody made. Ask: *who
  is this for, and who loses?*
- **What changes for them.** Concretely, in their words: what they can now do, what it costs
  them, what they will notice. Not "improved flexibility".
- **What it costs us.** Money, scope, a door closed, a segment given up. Ask directly: *what
  are we giving up by doing this?* A BDR with no cost is a wish.
- **What we are deliberately not doing.** The non-goals that come with it. This is the
  section that stops the decision quietly expanding for a year.
- **How we would know we were wrong.** The observable signal - a churn number, a support
  pattern, a segment that never converts. Ask: *what would we see in three months if this was
  the wrong call?* Push for something checkable; "if it doesn't work out" is not one.
- **Revisit when.** Usually the same signal, with a date or a threshold attached.

These are the template's own sections - `Who it serves`, `What this rules out` and `How we
would know we were wrong` exist in the BDR template and not in the ADR one, which is the
whole reason the two records are not the same form with different nouns.

## Draft first, ask second

Read `docs/PRODUCT.md` for the frame this sits in, `docs/personas.md` for who is affected,
and `docs/discovery/` for the conversation where it was argued. Most BDRs are the written
form of something already half-recorded. Draft from that and say where each part came from.

If the decision contradicts `PRODUCT.md`'s stated goals or non-goals, **say so before
writing** - either the product frame moved and should be updated in the same change, or this
decision is not yet made.

## Then

Number `BDR-NNN` - gapless, never reused. Find the next free number by **reading the
directory** (`ls docs/decision-records/bdr/`), never the README table's row count and never a
remembered count - the two can disagree, and `scripts/decision-records-check.mjs` exists
because a stale or missing index row let them (it minted a second `BDR-004` once). Do this as
of the latest `main`, right before writing: `git fetch` and re-check the number is still free
immediately before committing - two branches minting the same number from an older `main` is
a real collision this project has hit. Copy `docs/decision-records/bdr/_template.md`, add the
row to `bdr/README.md`, `Status: Accepted` on confirmation. An accepted record is superseded,
never edited into a different decision.

## Not this

- **Do not write the technical consequence here.** Which table, which service, which library
  is an ADR. If the record starts naming files, it has drifted.
- **Do not soften the cost.** The section exists so a future reader can tell whether the
  trade was worth it, and a BDR whose costs are all upside teaches them the records lie.
- **Do not record a decision the user is still thinking about.** That is an idea
  (`docs/ideas/`) until approved.
