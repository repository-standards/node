description: Use before changing how something already works - "what breaks if we change the refund window?", "who else depends on this before I touch it?". Finds everything the change ripples to across other capability specs, decision records and code, so the change does not land having updated only the obvious file.

Run when you are about to change how a capability works. Start from the **spec**,
then find the ripple. This is analysis - do not edit code yet.

## Steps

1. **Primary capability.** Which `specs/<capability>/` does this change belong to?
   If it is a genuinely new domain (rare), flag it - do not create a new capability
   spec just because a request or ticket exists. Search existing capabilities first.
   **Check the primary spec's `Status` first.** A `retired` capability stays in the
   repo as a record, not as something to extend - if the change targets one, stop
   and say so, and point at the BDR/ADR that retired it. A genuinely new need in
   that area is a new capability, specced fresh, not a reopening.

2. **Read** the primary spec and the code it maps to (`specs/capability-map.json`).

3. **Find the ripple:**
   - **Other capability specs** whose behavior this touches (cross-domain). A
     payments change may touch `bookings`, `refunds`, `notifications`.
   - **ADRs** - does the change need a new/superseding decision, or contradict an
     Accepted ADR? If it contradicts one, stop: an ADR comes first.
   - **Code / files** - which areas change (from the capability map + reading code):
     domain services, APIs, schemas, migrations, events, integrations, tests, UI,
     feature flags. Direct and indirect behavioral impact.

4. **File what this change will not address now.** A ripple found above - an
   affected capability, a needed ADR/BDR, a code area - that this change deliberately
   will not touch is real work, not scope creep to absorb: file it via
   `add-to-backlog` (source = this analysis) rather than letting it evaporate once the
   output below has been read and acted on only in part. A named backlog feeder
   (`docs/backlog.md`'s own "What feeds this backlog"), not a step this skill can skip
   just because nobody asked for it explicitly.

## Output

- Primary capability.
- Affected capabilities, with their spec paths.
- ADR impact: none / new / supersede (link).
- Code areas to change.
- Anything filed to the backlog because this change will not address it now.

This drives `spec-update` (which specs to edit) and the technical plan.
