name: spec-tasks
description: Use once a plan exists and it is time to turn it into ordered, checkable steps - "break the plan into tasks", "what do we build first, and in what order?". Groups tasks by requirement so each slice can be built and tested on its own, with the tests the repo's testing decision calls for.

<!-- Based on github/spec-kit v0.13.2 (MIT - scripts/spec/LICENSE). PATCHED hunks are marked inline. -->
<!-- PATCHED(repository-standards): ADR-010 clarify gate - mandatory precheck before task generation -->
**MANDATORY PRECHECK - the clarify gate.** Before anything else in this command, run `scripts/spec/check-spec-clarified.sh <FEATURE_SPEC>` from the repo root (resolve `FEATURE_SPEC` via `scripts/spec/check-prerequisites.sh --json --paths-only`). If it exits non-zero, STOP and run the clarify loop (`/spec-clarify`) - do not generate tasks for a spec that is not ready-to-develop (a spec is ready only when it has a `## Clarifications` section and zero open markers of the `[NEEDS ...` family - CLARIFICATION, DECISION, INPUT and ASSET alike, which is what the gate script counts).

<!-- PATCHED(repository-standards): the feature-resolution engine trusts a persisted
     pointer over the name in front of you - close that gap before it tasks the wrong spec. -->
**Also confirm you are breaking down the right feature.** `check-prerequisites.sh`
resolves `FEATURE_DIR` from `SPECIFY_FEATURE_DIRECTORY` or the persisted
`specs/feature.json` pointer, never from `$ARGUMENTS`. If `$ARGUMENTS` names a
capability, confirm the resolved directory actually matches it before running
`setup-tasks.sh` - a stale pointer from an earlier session silently generates tasks
for a different spec than the one you were just asked about.

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Outline

1. **Setup**: Run `scripts/spec/setup-tasks.sh --json` from repo root and parse FEATURE_DIR, TASKS_TEMPLATE, and AVAILABLE_DOCS list. `FEATURE_DIR` and `TASKS_TEMPLATE` must be absolute paths when provided. `AVAILABLE_DOCS` is a list of document names/relative paths available under `FEATURE_DIR` (for example `research.md` or `contracts/`). For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot").

<!-- PATCHED(repository-standards): ADR-032 - re-entry. Regenerating a task list over one
     that is already being worked, or already exported, used to be indistinguishable from
     a first run. -->
1a. **Re-entry check - does a task list already exist?** If `tasks.md` is already present with
   real tasks in it, this is a **regeneration** over work that may be in progress or already
   exported to a tracker. Before writing anything:
   - Carry over the status of every task that survives the change: a task marked done or in
     progress that the spec still asks for stays marked, and does not silently reset to
     unchecked. Losing that is losing the only record of where the work had got to.
   - Name what is **new** in this round and what is **gone**, in the reply. Both matter to
     whoever is mid-build.
   - **Task ids are positional and are not stable across rounds.** `T003` in this list is not
     the `T003` of the previous one. Nothing outside this file may key on a task id and assume
     it means the same work later - if this repo syncs to a tracker, that is the extension's
     problem to solve, and it solves it with fingerprints rather than positions
     ([tracker-sync (by reference)](https://github.com/repository-standards/core/blob/main/docs/method/tracker-sync.md)).

<!-- PATCHED(repository-standards): the spec is a capability spec - it has no user stories and
     no P1/P2/P3 priorities. Its Requirements areas, each with the Acceptance criteria that
     verify them, are the unit tasks group by; this file calls that a **requirement slice**. -->

2. **Load design documents**: Read from FEATURE_DIR:
   - **Required**: plan.md (tech stack, libraries, structure), spec.md (Requirements areas, Acceptance criteria, Data and Interface contracts)
   - **Optional**: data-model.md (entities), contracts/ (interface contracts), research.md (decisions), quickstart.md (test scenarios)
   - **IF EXISTS**: Load `specs/constitution.md` for project principles and governance constraints
   - Note: Not all projects have all documents. Generate tasks based on what's available.

3. **Execute task generation workflow**:
   - Load plan.md and extract tech stack, libraries, project structure
   - Load spec.md and derive the requirement slices: one per Requirements area, each carrying
     the Acceptance criteria that verify it. Order them by risk x leverage - money, security,
     external contracts and data integrity before cosmetics - since the spec states no priority
   - Take the Data contracts and Interface contracts from the spec itself; `data-model.md` and
     `contracts/` are plan-stage scaffolding and only refine what the spec already fixed
   - If research.md exists: Extract decisions for setup tasks
   - Generate tasks organized by requirement slice (see Task Generation Rules below)
   - Generate dependency graph showing slice completion order
   - Create parallel execution examples per slice
   - Validate task completeness: every acceptance criterion has a task that verifies it, and
     every slice is independently testable

4. **Generate tasks.md**: Read the tasks template from TASKS_TEMPLATE (from the JSON output above) and use it as structure. If TASKS_TEMPLATE is empty, fall back to `scripts/spec/tasks-template.md`. Fill with:
   - Correct feature name from plan.md
   - Phase 1: Setup tasks (project initialization)
   - Phase 2: Foundational tasks (blocking prerequisites for every slice)
   - Phase 3+: One phase per requirement slice, in the risk x leverage order derived above
   - Each phase includes: the slice's goal, its acceptance criteria as the independent test
     criteria, the test tasks the repo's testing strategy calls for, implementation tasks
   - Final Phase: Polish & cross-cutting concerns
   - All tasks must follow the strict checklist format (see Task Generation Rules below)
   - Clear file paths for each task
   - Dependencies section showing slice completion order
   - Parallel execution examples per slice
   - Implementation strategy section (first increment, then incremental delivery)

## Completion Report

Output path to generated tasks.md and summary:
- Total task count
- Task count per requirement slice
- Parallel opportunities identified
- Independent test criteria for each slice
- Suggested first increment (usually the highest risk x leverage slice alone)
- Any acceptance criterion left without a verifying task, named explicitly
- Format validation: Confirm ALL tasks follow the checklist format (checkbox, ID, labels, file paths)

Context for task generation: $ARGUMENTS

The tasks.md should be immediately executable - each task must be specific enough that an LLM can complete it without additional context.

## Task Generation Rules

<!-- PATCHED(repository-standards): the spec has no user stories - it is a capability spec.
     Tasks group by the requirement and the acceptance criteria that verify it. -->
**CRITICAL**: Tasks MUST be organized by requirement, each carrying the acceptance criteria
that verify it, so a slice can be implemented and tested independently.

<!-- PATCHED(repository-standards): tests are not a per-feature preference here. Testing
     strategy is one of the foundation forks every repo must consciously decide and record
     (R7), and a spec's Acceptance criteria are the test material. Upstream's "only if
     requested" quietly opts a repo out of its own recorded decision, one feature at a time. -->
**Tests follow the repo's recorded testing strategy**, never a per-feature preference. Read
the testing-strategy decision record and generate the tiers it names. On money, security,
external-contract and data-integrity paths they are non-negotiable. Every acceptance
criterion in the spec is test material: a criterion with no task that verifies it is drift
`/spec-reconcile` will report later, at a worse moment. If the repo has no testing-strategy
record yet, say so and file it - that missing decision is itself a task.

### Checklist Format (REQUIRED)

Every task MUST strictly follow this format:

```text
- [ ] [TaskID] [P?] [Slice?] Description with file path
```

**Format Components**:

1. **Checkbox**: ALWAYS start with `- [ ]` (markdown checkbox)
2. **Task ID**: Sequential number (T001, T002, T003...) in execution order
3. **[P] marker**: Include ONLY if task is parallelizable (different files, no dependencies on incomplete tasks)
4. **[Slice] label**: REQUIRED for requirement-slice phase tasks only
   - Format: [S1], [S2], [S3], etc. (maps to the Requirements areas of spec.md)
   - Setup phase: NO slice label
   - Foundational phase: NO slice label
   - Requirement-slice phases: MUST have slice label
   - Polish phase: NO slice label
5. **Description**: Clear action with exact file path

**Examples**:

- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T001 Create project structure per implementation plan`
- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T005 [P] Implement authentication middleware in src/middleware/auth.py`
- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T012 [P] [S1] Create User model in src/models/user.py`
- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T014 [S1] Implement UserService in src/services/user_service.py`
- ❌ WRONG: `- [ ] Create User model` (missing ID and slice label)
- ❌ WRONG: `T001 [S1] Create model` (missing checkbox)
- ❌ WRONG: `- [ ] [S1] Create User model` (missing Task ID)
- ❌ WRONG: `- [ ] T001 [S1] Create model` (missing file path)

### Task Organization

1. **From the Requirements areas (spec.md)** - PRIMARY ORGANIZATION:
   - Each requirement slice gets its own phase
   - Map all related components to their slice:
     - Models needed for that slice
     - Services needed for that slice
     - Interfaces/UI needed for that slice
     - The test tasks the repo's testing strategy calls for, specific to that slice
   - Mark slice dependencies (most slices should be independent)

2. **From the Interface contracts (spec.md)**:
   - Map each endpoint or public function → to the slice it serves
   - Each row of the spec's error table is a behaviour to implement and to verify, not a
     footnote - it is what makes the contract exhaustive rather than illustrative
   - Contract test task [P] before implementation in that slice's phase

3. **From the Data contracts (spec.md)**:
   - Map each table, column, enum and constraint to the slice(s) that need it
   - If it serves several slices: put it in the earliest slice or the Setup phase
   - Where the repo owns the database, the DDL and its typed twin move together, in one task -
     they are a declared 1:1 pair and a guard checks it

4. **From Setup/Infrastructure**:
   - Shared infrastructure → Setup phase (Phase 1)
   - Foundational/blocking tasks → Foundational phase (Phase 2)
   - Slice-specific setup → within that slice's phase

### Phase Structure

- **Phase 1**: Setup (project initialization)
- **Phase 2**: Foundational (blocking prerequisites - MUST complete before any slice)
- **Phase 3+**: Requirement slices, in the risk x leverage order derived from the spec
  - Within each slice: Tests → Models → Services → Endpoints → Integration
  - Each phase should be a complete, independently testable increment
- **Final Phase**: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

## Done When

- [ ] tasks.md generated with all phases, task IDs, and file paths
- [ ] Completion reported to user with task count, the per-slice breakdown, the first
      increment, and any acceptance criterion left without a verifying task
