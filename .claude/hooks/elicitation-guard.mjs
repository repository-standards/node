// elicitation-guard - a write to a gated artifact is refused until its question was asked.
//
// PreToolUse hook. Reads the tool call on stdin, and refuses Write/Edit to a path some
// elicitation point gates unless that point's question already fired in this session.
//
// This exists because the two weaker mechanisms are not enough on their own. A sentence in
// a skill telling the agent to ask has no force: the rule was written in onboard.md, in the
// right place and in plain words, and a full adoption ignored it. A gate on the artifact
// catches the omission at review, which is after the personas were invented and after the
// owner's directory naming was replaced across seventy-eight files. Only a hook refuses
// before the write lands, and only a hook is not the model's decision to make.
//
// It cannot cover everything, and says so rather than implying it does. Most points gate a
// path, and adopt.layout gates a rename - which arrives as a shell command
// rather than a write, so this hook reads Bash too. Renaming what a repository already has
// is the single most destructive thing an adoption does, because it looks like tidying: one
// unasked move put seventy-eight files under different names and broke fifty-three links.
// Only paths git already tracks count - a file the adoption itself created a minute ago is
// its own to move. The rest gate something this hook cannot see - a phase boundary, a commit,
// a layout that does not exist yet; the static check and human review carry those.
//
// Fail-close. No transcript means the question cannot be shown to have happened, and a
// guard that waves work through when it has no evidence is the exact defect it was built
// to catch. The refusal says which point is missing and what the three answers are, so the
// remedy is one call away rather than a puzzle.
//
// Two things settle a point besides asking in this session. A repository-scoped question -
// who the product is for, how the records are kept, which profile it runs at - is asked once,
// and a committed row in docs/adoption-provenance.md answers it for every session after. Work-
// scoped questions get none of that: the scope of a specification is not answered by a row
// about a different one, so those are asked every time. Without the distinction this guard is
// not strict but unlivable, refusing an ordinary decision record months after adoption until
// the run re-asks an adoption question - and a guard nobody can work under gets deleted.
//
// The other thing it deliberately does NOT forbid: writing a stub. A run with nobody watching
// cannot ask, and a guard that only accepts an answered question would leave such a run no
// legal move at all - which in practice means the guard gets taken out rather than obeyed.
// So the write is also allowed when the content itself declares that point `absent` (or
// `inferred`, where the point permits it): visibly not claiming an answer is honest, and it
// is guessing that this exists to stop. What it costs is paid later and in the open - the
// artifact gate checks a declared stub really is one, and the run reads as incomplete
// rather than as done.
//
// Ships to adopting repos. Node built-ins only.
//
// Speaks the same contract as the other hooks here, and for the same reason: a refusal is
// well-formed deny JSON on stdout with exit 0, never a nonzero exit. verifyAgentGuards.sh
// scores a nonzero exit as BROKEN, and it is right to - the hooks are silent when they
// allow, so an exit code is the one signal that cannot be told apart from a crash.
