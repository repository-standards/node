# Every SQL client, not only the Postgres ones.

# This guard shipped Postgres-only for its whole life - psql, pgcli, `postgres://` - and a repo
# that runs MySQL got no protection at all. `mysql -h db.prod.example.com -e "DROP TABLE users"`
# ran straight through, and so did a `mysql2://` connection string, because neither the client
# name nor the scheme appeared in any pattern. A guard that only prints on refusal makes that
# indistinguishable from approval. Found by probing it during a Rails adoption, not by reading.
#
# Scope, said plainly so it is not read as more: WRITE_RE above is SQL vocabulary, so this covers
# the SQL family. A document or key-value store reached remotely is NOT covered - `mongosh` and
# `redis-cli` write with verbs this pattern does not know, and implying otherwise here would be
# worse than the gap itself.

# stays. But requiring the verb in the SAME segment turned every ordinary way of writing a long
# command into a bypass: a pipe, a backslash line-wrap and a heredoc each put the host in one
# segment and the verb in another, and the guard fell silent. Nothing about a wrapped line is
# adversarial - an agent formatting a long psql call for readability disabled the control.
#
# The cost is false positives: a remote SELECT next to an unrelated `rm -f` denies, because `-f`
# is one of the write signals. That is the correct direction for this control, and the way out
# is to run the two commands separately, not to narrow the check.
