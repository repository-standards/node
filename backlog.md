# Backlog

The work ledger for this repository. An item earns a row when it has evidence - what was
observed, not what someone suspects. Statuses: `todo` / `doing` / `blocked` / `done`. Drop
`done` rows when a release is cut.

Technology picks do not belong here. A pick that should change is a change to
[`DECISIONS.md`](DECISIONS.md) with its reasoning; this file holds work on the repository.

| Id | What | Why | Done when | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| SELF-1 | Decide how a stack repository satisfies its own stack manifest | With both manifests present, this repository fails four of its own required entries and its own guard. `biome.json`, `tsconfig.base.json`, `pnpm-workspace.yaml` and `vitest.config.ts` are demanded at the repository root; they exist in [`starter/`](starter), which is where a stack ships them. The `stack-check-all` guard runs `pnpm check:all` at a root with no `package.json` and fails `ERR_PNPM_NO_IMPORTER_MANIFEST_FOUND`. The entries describe a repository that **consumes** this stack; this repository **publishes** it, and the manifest schema has no word for the difference. A guard cannot be waived by a manifest exception by design, so the four files could be excepted and the guard could not - meaning there is no configuration of the shipped mechanism that lets this repository reach an honest drift 0 | a recorded decision, and this repository's drift number honest under it. Options, none yet chosen: **(a)** the schema gains a publisher scope, so an entry can declare it binds adopters rather than the stack repository; **(b)** the verifier learns the difference structurally - a repository whose `stack.manifest.json` is the source rather than a copy - which needs a way to tell source from copy that does not depend on the remote URL; **(c)** the guard becomes path-aware, which then ships a `starter/`-shaped path to every adopter, where it is wrong; **(d)** the stack repository is accepted as a non-adopter of its own layer, which contradicts [`SHIPPED.md`](SHIPPED.md)'s "the same engine that verifies the standard verifies this layer" for the one repository where it is most visible. Confirmed 2026-09-03 (`adopt.intent`): this gap is declined by design for a stack-publisher repository, not unfinished migration work - the decision below is which of (a)-(d) makes that declination structural rather than tribal knowledge | todo |
| SELF-2 | A stack manifest is invisible until a core manifest arrives | The verifier merges `stack.manifest.json` only inside a branch already guarded by the core manifest being present. Before this alignment, this repository carried a stack manifest with twelve file entries and one guard, and the verifier read none of them - it reported against its five-check built-in skeleton and said so. The published claim is one drift number across both layers; for a repository holding only the technology layer, the count is silently zero of it | either the verifier reads a stack manifest on its own and says what it can and cannot check without the core layer, or the claim is narrowed to adopters of both. Whichever is chosen is recorded, so the next reader does not rediscover it | todo |
| SELF-3 | Name this stack's own prerequisites where a reader will find them | [`SHIPPED.md`](SHIPPED.md) already states the gap in prose: the core's prerequisites page lists what every guard needs generically, "and nothing here names it yet." `check:all` needs pnpm on `PATH` and a completed `pnpm install` - the full tree, network required at least once - which is a materially larger ask than the core's Node, git, bash and jq | this stack's additions appear in the same table shape the core uses, and the sentence admitting they are missing is deleted because it stopped being true | todo |
| SELF-4 | Decide what a red heartbeat costs | The core's stack policy makes a live boot CI a condition of staying listed, and [`.github/workflows/starter-boot.yml`](.github/workflows/starter-boot.yml) supplies the pulse. Nothing in this repository says how long red is tolerated, who is told, or who acts. A delisting condition nobody can trigger is not a condition | a threshold and an owner recorded, or the policy's consequence acknowledged as the core's to exercise rather than this repository's | todo |
| SELF-7 | Declare the `check:all` guard's prerequisites once the core supports them | With the toolchain absent, this guard's failure string is **character for character** the same as a guard that ran and failed on three real lint errors - so a missing tool and broken code are indistinguishable in the drift report. The core added a `requires` field so a guard whose prerequisites are absent is reported as not run rather than as drift | this stack's guard declares `"requires": [{ "kind": "command", "match": "pnpm" }, { "kind": "path", "match": "node_modules", "hint": "run pnpm install once - the full tree, network required" }]` - landed with the update to core 1.0.5 | done |
| SELF-6 | The summary table and the numbered sections disagree about what the picks are | [`WHAT-THIS-IS.md`](WHAT-THIS-IS.md) says "Eighteen picks"; [`DECISIONS.md`](DECISIONS.md) has 17 numbered sections. Both are defensible, because they count different things: the summary table has 18 rows, section 10 covers three of them at once (proxy, auth, styling), and section 17 (monorepo layout) has **no row in the table at all**. The wrong number is the symptom; the real defect is that the table, which the document presents as its spine, does not cover one of the picks. A reader who triages from the table never learns monorepo layout was decided | the table and the sections cover the same set, and any restated count becomes a checked fact rather than prose - `scripts/facts-check.mjs` now ships here and `docs/facts.json` does not exist yet, which is the mechanism this is for | todo |
| SELF-5 | Say what a partial adoption's resting state is | The drift number counts what was taken rather than what exists, which is what makes a partial adoption legible. But nothing states that a repository taking four entries and declining the rest has *finished* - so a low number reads as an unfinished adoption forever, and the reader who chose deliberately looks non-compliant | a stated resting state for a declined entry, consistent with how the core records a deviation | todo |
| SELF-8 | Decide this repository's manifest profile - `core` or `scale` | The elicitation ledger's `green.stack` point asked which profile applies. The first answer given was `scale`; raised back was the actual cost - `self-verify --profile scale` checks roughly nine more entries than `core`, unverified whether this repository already satisfies them - and whether to switch now, expanding the update-to-1.0.6 PR, or defer. No reconfirmation came either way, so `standard.manifest.json` keeps `"profile": "core"` unchanged rather than silently picking a side | a deliberate answer, reached on its own rather than folded into an unrelated PR: either the profile moves to `scale` with the new entries measured and satisfied, or `core` is confirmed as right for this repository's actual reach and the reasoning is recorded | todo |
| SELF-9 | Confirm backlog row attribution style | The elicitation ledger's `adopt.backlog` point asks whether rows should name a role, a person, or nothing. The question that got answered instead was a different one - where the backlog physically lives, not how a row is attributed - so this repository's rows keep the pattern already in use (no owner/role column, matching every row here) as a default, not a confirmed choice | either the current pattern is confirmed as intentional, or rows start naming a role per the standard's own recommended default | todo |
| SELF-10 | Reconfirm scope and acceptance criteria for `specs/stack-contract/spec.md` with a human | The elicitation ledger's `spec.scope` and `spec.acceptance` points were reached when this update added the spec's missing Interface contracts section - both sections' existing content was carried forward unchanged, not re-decided, so the provenance is recorded as `provisional` rather than `human` | a human either confirms the existing Scope and Acceptance criteria sections still hold, or revises them, and the ledger rows move to `human` | todo |

## Alignment scope

The count Gate 5 asks for: what stands between this repository and a complete record of
itself, not how much of the standard it has taken. Recomputed whenever a row above closes or a
new one lands - if this ever disagrees with the table above it, the table is right and this is
stale.
