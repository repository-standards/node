// Work-cycle guard (ADR-028).
//
// One intent is in the backlog pool OR in exactly one cycle - never both, never two.
// That property is what makes the pair trustworthy: a backlog that also lists what is
// already in flight is a backlog nobody believes, and a convention held by discipline
// stops being held. So it is checked rather than asked for.
//
// Three directions, all checked: an id in more than one place (the clash check below), an
// id a closed cycle's outcome names as "returned to the pool" that never actually lands
// there (the "at least one" check further down), and a cycle file whose rows this guard
// cannot find at all - no `## Intents` heading, or rows under it with no id in the first
// cell (`unreadable`, also below). The first catches too many places, the second catches
// zero, the third catches a cycle that reads as empty when it is actually unparseable -
// which looks identical to a clean cycle from the outside.
//
// Usage:
//   node scripts/cycle-guard.mjs            # report, exit 0 (advisory)
//   node scripts/cycle-guard.mjs --block    # exit 1 on a violation (CI, scale profile)
//
// No dependencies (Node built-ins only). A repo with no cycle files is not using cycles -
// the guard says so and exits 0, at every profile.

// <!-- was PAY-4 --> the export |` opened and closed on one line and deleted a real row,
// and a `-->` appearing in prose (`migrate A --> B`) inside an example block ended the
// comment early, resurrecting every example row after it.
//
// `scopeToIntents` restricts matching to the `## Intents` section - same fix as
// spec-structure.mjs's persona-roster heading scoping, for the same reason. cycle-close's
// own documented output is a close table (id / assignee / DoD met? / where it went) shown
// under `## Outcome`, and its rows start with the same intent ids on purpose - a reader
// screenshots that table into a channel. Without scoping, this guard read that table as a
// second copy of every intent it names, reporting the exact "copied, not moved" failure it
// exists to catch on a cycle that was closed correctly. The pool (`docs/backlog.md`) has no
// second ID-shaped table to collide with, so it keeps the whole-file scan.
//
// Scoping to a heading is also how the check switches itself off, which is why the scan
// reports what it saw as well as what it found: a cycle file using `### Intents`, `## Work`
// or the id-and-title-in-one-cell shape that the folder manual documented yielded zero
// rows, and zero rows is indistinguishable from a clean cycle. Both are errors now, and
// `sawIntents` / `bodyRows` are what the caller needs to tell them apart.
//
// The id cell is found by the header row's `id` column, not by position. A hardcoded column
// 0 broke the moment a table prepended a column of its own (a priority, a team) ahead of
// it - the row still had an id, just not where the guard was looking, so it silently stopped
// counting. `idCol` is re-resolved every time a separator row is seen, from the header row
// captured just above it (`headerCells`); a table with no column literally named `id` falls
