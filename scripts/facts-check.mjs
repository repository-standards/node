// facts-check - a fact lives in one place; every other place must agree with it.
//
// The code<->spec coupling map made a declared edge out of "these move together".
// This is the same idea one level down, for facts restated in prose: a count, a
// path, a command. They drift silently because nothing connects the sentence to
// what it describes - the standard shipped "twenty rules" while SPEC.md had 21,
// and "11 lifecycle skills" while the tree held 12.
//
// Two mechanisms, different jobs. tree-check BANS a fact from surfaces where it
// adds nothing (say "the numbered rules"). This one covers facts that legitimately
// appear in several places: state them once at home, declare every restatement,
// and fail when they disagree.
//
// A claim whose pattern matches nothing is a failure too. A surface reworded past
// its own pattern stops being covered, and silence would look identical to
// agreement - which is how a check rots into decoration.
//
// The boundary: every mechanism here reads UTF-8 TEXT. A repo whose canonical fact
// lives inside a binary artifact - a font's version in its TTF name table, a version
// resource compiled into an executable - has no home this file can express, and
// pointing one at the bytes gave two arbitrary answers depending on the encoding
// that artifact happened to use: an ASCII string inside the binary matched and
// reported a green tick over a file this cannot parse, a UTF-16 one reported "the
// home pattern matches nothing", which reads as a bad pattern. Both are worse than
// a refusal, so a binary file is now refused by name, with the way out stated: give
// the fact a text home the artifact is BUILT from, or leave the restatement
// undeclared and say so where it is restated. An unchecked fact somebody knows about
// beats a check that answers by coin flip.
//
// Declare facts in docs/facts.json (R4):
//   [{ "id": "...", "what": "...",
//      "home":   { "count": "<glob>" }                                   how many files match
//              | { "countMatches": { "file": "...", "pattern": "..." } }  how many times one file declares it
//              | { "read": "<file>" }                                     the file's whole content
//              | { "match": { "file": "...", "pattern": "...(capture)..." } },
//      "claims": [{ "file": "...", "pattern": "...(capture)..." }] }]
//
// Usage:
//   node scripts/facts-check.mjs [--facts docs/facts.json]   # exit 1 on any failure
//
// No dependencies (Node built-ins only). Place at scripts/facts-check.mjs.
