# PATCHED(repository-standards): ADR-010 clarify gate. This file is NOT an upstream
# github/spec-kit script - it is this standard's addition to the vendored engine.
#
# Blocks plan/tasks on a spec that is not ready-to-develop. A spec passes when:
#   1. it contains a "## Clarifications" section, and
#   2. it contains zero open markers of the "[NEEDS ..." family (ADR-024):
#      CLARIFICATION (a question), DECISION (a missing ADR/BDR), INPUT (e.g. a
#      UX design), ASSET (e.g. credentials) - each names what is missing and
#      who brings it, so the open markers double as the spec's gap list, and
#   3. nothing in it is merely SHAPED like a marker - a translated family name or
#      an invented type is a gap the gate cannot read, so it fails instead, and
#   4. it contains a "## Open questions" section that says there are none.
# Passing this gate is what earns the spec "Status: ready-to-develop".
#
# Every check fails CLOSED, and that is the point of the file: three separate
# fail-open bugs got a spec to ready-to-develop with its questions still live,
# and each one looked exactly like a passing gate.
#
# Usage: check-spec-clarified.sh <path-to-spec.md>
# Exit codes: 0 = gate passed; 1 = gate failed (message on stderr).
# Plain bash + grep only - no jq, no python, no other dependencies.

# Reaching here means the file holds zero markers of the four known forms - the check
# above counts them literally and exits on the first one. So any remaining token that is
# SHAPED like a typed marker is one the gate cannot read: a translated family name
# ("[BRAK DECYZJI: ...]", "[需要澄清: ...]"), or an invented type. That is the fail-open
# this catches, and it was reproduced: a spec written in Chinese, its markers translated
# with the family, printed PASS with four unresolved items including a missing decision.

# The asymmetry is what made it inevitable rather than unlucky. The '## Clarifications'
# check above fails CLOSED and names the exact English string, so a team that hits it
# "fixes" the error by translating the heading and lands in a silent pass.

# --- the spec's own open-questions section -------------------------------------------
# The capability template makes "## Open questions" a REQUIRED section, in free prose, and
# the gate never read it. Four shapes were reproduced passing with questions live: prose
# markers, a question phrased as a statement, a table of open items, and an item resolved
# above but still listed here. Reading intent out of free text is not the answer; the rule
# is structural, and it is the whole rule:
#
#   this section passes only when it says there are none.
#
# So an unresolved gap goes where it belongs - a typed marker in its functional section,
# which the checks above hold closed - a settled note goes into the section it describes,
# and anything worth keeping but not worth blocking on goes to the backlog with a link.
# HTML comments and fenced blocks are stripped first: that is where the template's own
# guidance lives, and the template must not trip the rule it teaches.
#
# Pure bash and grep, per this engine's dependency rule. grep runs only on the handful of
# lines inside the section, not per line of the file.
