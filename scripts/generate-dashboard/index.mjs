#!/usr/bin/env node
// Renders a repository's work state as one static page: _dashboard/index.html.
//
// Everything it shows is read from committed files - the backlog pool, the sprints, the
// changelog, the decision records, the specs. Two people who run it on the same commit get
// byte-identical output, so the page is a projection of the repo and never a second place
// where work is tracked. Sources that a repo does not have are skipped, not faked.
//
//   node scripts/generate-dashboard/index.mjs [repo-root] [--out <file>] [--watch] [--serve [port]]
//                                            [--anonymise] [--with-discovery]
//
// --watch rebuilds when a source file changes; --serve adds a local server so an open page
// notices and offers a refresh. Neither ever touches git: a page going stale is a display
// problem, and fixing it by moving somebody's branch would be a much worse one.
//
// --anonymise keeps names out of the structured fields: assignees, and the person a sprint
// names as its owner. It is not redaction - prose written by hand (an item's status note, a
// sprint's outcome, a changelog entry) is reproduced as written, so a build that must carry no
// names needs the sources checked too. The page never contains anything the repository does
// not already contain, which is the whole security model: a private repository's page is
// private data and belongs behind whatever gate the repository is behind.
//
// --with-discovery additionally carries the BODIES of the discovery dossiers into the page.
// Off by default, and deliberately: a dossier is the one folder holding raw material about
// named people - who said what at which meeting, quoted from a client's mail - and this page
// is built by a workflow that publishes it. Titles, stamps and counts ship either way, since
// those are the state; the material itself only ships when somebody asks for it in the
// command that builds the page. --anonymise turns it back off whatever the flags say.
