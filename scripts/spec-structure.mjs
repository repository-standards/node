// Spec-structure guard.
//
// Three mechanical structure checks on capability specs:
//   1. No ticket-numbered spec paths (`specs/<NNN-feature>/`, `specs/<cap>/<NNN-...>`) -
//      e.g. a leaked GitHub Spec Kit `specs/001-core/` folder. Capability specs live at
//      `specs/<capability>/spec.md` (or named sub-specs `specs/<capability>/<name>.md`) -
//      domain names, never numbers.
//   2. Every capability spec names a **persona from the roster** it serves (ADR-006, R10),
//      when the repo has a `docs/personas.md` - a spec that serves no one is incomplete,
//      and so is one that serves someone who does not exist. The roster table is the
//      constraint: a `**Serves:**` value naming nobody on it fails, and a roster the guard
//      cannot read is reported rather than treated as a roster that forbids nothing.
//   3. A spec's `**Status:**` is earned, not typed: one claiming `ready-to-develop` or
//      `live` must pass the clarify gate. Nothing read or wrote that field, so the status
//      the whole method reads as "this is settled" was decorative - a spec with four
//      guards green and a failing gate still said ready-to-develop.
//   4. A section heading appears once. A second `## Clarifications` - written instead of a
//      new `### Session` under the existing one - splits the section every reader and the
//      clarify gate take the first match of.
//   5. A spec that declares the buildable tier carries the sections that make it
//      buildable (R9). The template marked them REQUIRED and nothing read the template,
//      so a buildable spec shipped without its contracts and the sections were
//      retrofitted later, by hand, when somebody noticed.
//
// This is the "structure lint" half of specs/enforcement.md, made mechanical - the
// complement to the coupling guard (spec-guard.mjs).
//
// Usage:
//   node scripts/spec-structure.mjs                 # full tree (git ls-files) - audit / conformance
//   node scripts/spec-structure.mjs --staged        # pre-commit (staged files), warn only
//   node scripts/spec-structure.mjs --base <ref>    # CI (files changed vs base ref)
//   add --block to exit non-zero on a violation (default: warn, exit 0)
//
// No dependencies (Node built-ins only).
