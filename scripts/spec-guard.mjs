// Spec-policy coupling guard.
//
// Flags when code in a capability's domain changed without touching that
// capability's spec - the mechanical half of the spec policy (same-PR spec
// coupling, source-of-truth rule 5). It cannot prove the spec is correct; it
// forces the author to touch the spec or consciously decide not to.
//
// Reads specs/capability-map.json:  { "<capability>": [<entry>, ...], ... }
// An entry is a glob string - every edit to a matching file couples - or
// { "glob": "<glob>", "couples": "shape" } for a JSON file the capability reads,
// where the key shape is the contract: added entries and edited values are data
// and do not couple, a key path that appears or disappears is an interpretation
// change and does. Without that distinction a data edit demands a spec update
// with nothing to write, and the cheapest way out is a cosmetic one.
//
// A glob string may start with `!`, which excludes: the capability claims everything
// its other globs match EXCEPT these paths. Two capabilities can legitimately live in
// one domain folder - a sibling that grew out of the first - and with globs alone the
// only shapes available were "the folder" (both specs demanded on every edit) or a
// hand-enumerated file list that goes stale in silence. `"swap": ["src/swap/**",
// "!src/swap/audit*"]` beside `"swap-audit": ["src/swap/audit*"]` says which file
// belongs to which. An exclusion is a claim boundary, not a coupling mode, so it is
// only ever the plain string form.
//
// A further form, { "external": "<repo>", "reason": "..." }, is for a capability whose
// implementation lives in a repository this one does not own - a plugin, a satellite
// `rules_*` repo, a vendor SDK. No glob here can reach that code, so the map had no way
// to say it: the choice was a glob matching nothing (which --audit reports, correctly, as
// a guard watching an empty set) or leaving the capability out of the map (which --audit
// reports as an orphan spec). Both are wrong about a real, common shape, and being wrong
// in a way the author has to route around is how the map stops being maintained. An
// external entry couples nothing mechanically - the code is not here to watch - so it
// carries a reason and is counted out loud in --audit's line.
//
// Two keys in that file are metadata rather than capabilities: `$about` (a note)
// and `$unclaimed` (globs for the paths that belong to no capability by decision -
// config, tooling, docs). --audit reads the second to tell code nobody claims from
// code deliberately claimed by nobody.
//
// Globs are translated by scripts/lib/glob.mjs - `**` matches zero segments as well
// as many, so `**/payment/**` covers `payment/index.ts` at the top level.
//
// Usage:
//   node scripts/spec-guard.mjs --staged          # pre-commit (staged files), warn only
//   node scripts/spec-guard.mjs --base <ref>      # CI (diff vs base ref)
//   node scripts/spec-guard.mjs --audit           # full-tree: the map is sound (see below)
//   add --block to exit non-zero on a violation (default: warn, exit 0)
//
// No dependencies (Node built-ins only). Place at scripts/spec-guard.mjs.
