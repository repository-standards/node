// Backlog archive guard (R15, ADR-051).
//
// Closing a backlog row is a relocation, not a deletion: the finding goes to a record, a spec
// or a dossier, what shipped goes to the CHANGELOG, and the row itself moves to
// `docs/backlog-archive.md` carrying a `where` cell naming what its content became. The rule
// existed as an aside for a year ("drop `done` rows on release") and was universally ignored,
// because following it destroyed the only written record of findings that produced no commit.
// An accepted rule with no guard is the defect that record is about, so:
//
//   1. removed, not archived - a diff that takes a row out of the pool without that id
//      reaching the archive. This is the one that matters; it fires seventeen times on the
//      commit that motivated the record.
//   2. empty `where`         - "a row that cannot be relocated was not done", made mechanical.
//   3. `where` points nowhere - a path named in the cell that is not in the repository. Same
//      class of failure decision-records-check reports for an index row citing a missing file.
//   4. in both files         - the one-place invariant sprint-guard asserts between the pool
//      and a sprint, extended to the pool and the archive.
//
// Exempt from (1), because neither is a closure: an id that appears in a sprint file (it left
// the pool, it did not close) and a row carrying `split:<id>` whose remainder row is live.
//
// **What "skips itself" means here**, since the two halves differ and the difference is the
// whole enforcement: checks 2-4 read the archive, so they skip where there is no archive - an
// adopter who has closed nothing is never failed by a file they do not have. Check 1 does not
// skip on a missing archive, because the first closure is exactly when the archive is supposed
// to appear; skipping there would exempt every repo that has never archived, which is every
// repo the rule is written for. It skips where no base ref is given (nothing to diff) or where
// the pool itself is absent.
//
// What this does NOT check: whether the destination actually captures the finding. That is
// substance, and ADR-038 settled that this project measures structure and leaves substance to
// judgment rather than converting it into ceremony. A `where` can point at any file that
// exists - the guard catches the empty answer and the broken one, never the lazy one.
//
// Usage:
//   node scripts/backlog-archive-check.mjs                  # archive shape only
//   node scripts/backlog-archive-check.mjs --base <ref>     # CI: also the removal check
//   add --block to exit non-zero on a violation (default: warn, exit 0)
//
// No dependencies (Node built-ins only). Place at scripts/backlog-archive-check.mjs.
