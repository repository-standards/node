// Adoption-gate artifact guard (R27).
//
// The checkmap calls the gate order and "every gate produces its artifact" rigid and
// framework-enforced. Two of those artifacts had a defined shape and nothing that read it:
//
//   Gate 2 - the assessment health report: maturity per pass (absent / partial / solid),
//            top risks, findings grouped by the owner role that must act.
//   Gate 5 - the counted backlog: a scope block whose categories sum to a stated total,
//            every item naming its owner role. That total is the human's go/no-go.
//
// Gate 0's artifact became a manifest entry in 0.9.0 (R26, ADR-042) and is, measurably, the
// only one of the three that adoption runs reliably produce. That is the whole argument for
// this guard: presence in the manifest is what makes a gate happen, and presence alone is not
// enough for these two, because a file can exist and still not carry the number.
//
// What this checks is shape, never judgment. It cannot tell a considered `partial` from a
// guessed one. It can tell that eight passes were rated, that the arithmetic in the scope
// block is real, and that somebody was named for every item - the three ways these artifacts
// fail silently.
//
// Deliberately NOT checked: whether the maturity is accurate, whether the risks are the real
// ones, or whether the owner named is the right person's role. Those need a reader.
//
// Usage:
//   node scripts/adoption-gates.mjs [--assessment <path>] [--backlog <path>]
//   add --block to exit non-zero on a violation (default: warn, exit 0)
//
// No dependencies (Node built-ins only). Place at scripts/adoption-gates.mjs.
