// self-verify - prove this repo still complies with the standard it is pinned to.
//
// The "verify" step of the versioned-standard mechanism. Runs after adopting the
// standard (align-to-standards), after updating it (update-to-latest), and in CI on
// every PR - the same pass/fail each time. This is the mechanical tier; the judgment
// tier (are the catalogued decisions actually recorded? are the money/security specs
// buildable?) is reviewed at PR - see self-verify.md, adopted by reference:
// https://github.com/repository-standards/core/blob/main/docs/method/self-verify.md
//
// Manifest-driven (ADR-005). When standard.manifest.json is present, this reads it and
// checks the repo against every entry - files, required sections, static guards - and
// reports DRIFT as a number (how many required entries are unmet). The manifest is the
// single source of truth; without one, it falls back to a built-in skeleton so the check
// still works on repos that predate the manifest.
//
// Checks (assembled/client layout):
//   1. .standards-version is present and well-formed (x.y.z); with --version <target> it
//      must equal that target; and it must equal the manifest's version when a manifest
//      is present (a repo pinned to X carries manifest X).
//   1b. Content, for the entries whose content is the standard's own: a `copy` entry
//      carries a recorded `sha256` (a string for a file, one hash per member for a
//      directory), and the local file must hash to it. Existence alone was close to no
//      check for these: 19 of 20 skills, last version's SPEC.md, or a guard with its
//      policy block deleted all reported drift 0. A `merge` entry cannot be hashed - it is
//      adapted on purpose - so it may declare `requiredKeys` naming what must survive the
//      merge (JSON and YAML block mappings), because "the file exists" is worthless when
//      the point of the entry is a block inside it.
//   2. Manifest (or fallback skeleton): required files/altPaths exist; required sections
//      are present in their files; static guards pass. Each entry may carry a profile
//      (core|scale, ADR-011) - core is whatever keeps knowledge alive, scale is whatever
//      coordinates people. --profile core checks core only; --profile scale checks everything;
//      no flag = the manifest copy's "profile" field, then scale. solo/team are
//      accepted silently as deprecated aliases
//      (solo -> core, team -> scale). An entry with no profile counts as core, so
//      manifests from before ADR-011 still check in full either way.
//   2b. A guard whose prerequisites are absent is NOT RUN, and that is reported as its own
//      thing rather than as drift. Running `pnpm check:all` on a machine with no pnpm used
//      to score exactly what a genuine lint failure scores, so the number said "this
//      laptop" in the words of one that says "this repo".
//   2c. removedPaths (ADR-052): every path the standard has removed must be absent from this
//      repo - hand-maintained at release time, not diffed from a tree, so the check needs no
//      provenance data; a repo that never carried the path passes trivially. Waivable through
//      `exceptions` like any other required entry.
//   3. Stray transition skills (ADR-009): align-to-standards, onboard-repo, modernize,
//      greenfield-start never ship in a consuming repo. One found under .claude/skills/
//      is a hand-copy mistake, flagged as a warning - it does not add to drift.
//   4. What drift 0 does NOT say. The number is the manifest, so a repo can meet every
//      entry and have specified no behaviour at all. When no capability spec exists, the
//      verdict says so instead of printing an unqualified "compliant with the standard".
//

// 2c. what a guard needs before it can answer anything ---------------------------
// A guard reports on the repo only when the tools it shells out to are actually here. With
// no pnpm on PATH, `pnpm check:all` exited non-zero with a bare `command not found` and
// scored `drift 1 - 99% adopted (78/79)` - byte for byte what a genuine lint failure on a
// compliant repo scores. Two different questions, one number, no way to tell them apart.
// prerequisites.md already states the rule this restores: self-verify scores the repo's
// structure, not the machine it runs on, and a laptop missing a tool is not repository
// drift.
//
// So a guard whose prerequisites are absent is NOT RUN: never drift, never a pass, named in
// its own category and again in the verdict. Prerequisites come from two places.
//
//   Declared, on the guard entry:
//     "requires": [{ "kind": "command", "match": "pnpm" },
//                  { "kind": "path", "match": "node_modules", "hint": "..." }]
//   The `path` kind is what keeps a compliance check from having side effects. With a
//   package manager present and its dependency tree absent, RUNNING the guard is what
//   installs the tree - off the network, as a side effect of asking a question about the
//   repo; recorded once at 376 packages and ~670 MB, and reproducible on demand, though
//   whether it fires at all turns out to depend on the package manager's local settings.
//   The only way not to do it is to look before shelling out, and only the entry that knows
//   the toolchain can say what to look for.
//
//   Inferred, from `run`: every bare command word that is no shell builtin and resolves
//   nowhere on PATH. This is the part that needs nothing declared, so a stack whose guard
//   predates the field still gets a legible answer.
//
// Inference errs toward RUNNING the guard, in every direction it can be wrong, because the
// wrong answer here is a check that quietly stops running:
//   - quoted text is blanked before anything is split, so a tool named inside an error
//     message is never probed;
//   - a word carrying a `/` is left to the script rule below, since a relative path means
//     something different after a `cd`;
//   - `a || b` is a FALLBACK, not two requirements: the group is satisfied when either side
//     resolves, and reporting `b` because `a` was taken would skip a guard that works;
//   - the node executing this file is never probed - a runtime invoked by absolute path
//     from outside PATH would otherwise silence every guard at once;
//   - anything this cannot parse runs exactly as it did before.

  //   - a code span that WRAPS A LINE BREAK. git/git's README.md:26-27 reads
  //     "`man git-<commandname>` or `git help\n<commandname>`" - the span crosses the line
  //     end, the old `[^`\n]*` refused to cross it, and the leftover `<commandname>` on the
  //     next line was read as a placeholder. A span may now contain newlines but never a
  //     BLANK line, so an unmatched backtick cannot swallow the rest of the file.
  //     The delimiter is a RUN of backticks matched by its own length, which is what
  //     markdown says and what keeps the pairing local: with a single-backtick pattern, a
  //     `` `x` `` span (the form used to show a backtick) left an odd backtick behind and
  //     every span after it paired one position out - which, once spans could cross lines,
  //     exposed the notation on the following lines instead of stripping it.
  //   - an INDENTED code block (four spaces or a tab, the pre-fence form). vim/vim's own
  //     AGENTS.md:92 carries `Signed-off-by: Author Name <email>` inside one.
  // A four-space indent under a list item is a continuation paragraph rather than code, so
