// self-verify - prove this repo still complies with the standard it is pinned to.
//
// The "verify" step of the versioned-standard mechanism. Runs after adopting the
// standard (align-to-standards), after updating it (update-to-version), and in CI on
// every PR - the same pass/fail each time. This is the mechanical tier; the judgment
// tier (are the catalogued decisions actually recorded? are the money/security specs
// buildable?) is reviewed at PR - see self-verify.md, adopted by reference:
// https://github.com/repository-standards/core/blob/main/docs/method/self-verify.md
//
// Manifest-driven (ADR-005). When standard.manifest.json is present, this reads it and
// checks the repo against every entry - files, required sections, static guards - and
// reports DRIFT as a number (how many required entries are unmet). The manifest is the
// single source of truth; without one, it falls back to a built-in skeleton so the check
// still works on repos that predate the manifest.
//
// Checks (assembled/client layout):
//   1. .standards-version is present and well-formed (x.y.z); with --version <target> it
//      must equal that target; and it must equal the manifest's version when a manifest
//      is present (a repo pinned to X carries manifest X).
//   1b. Content, for the entries whose content is the standard's own: a `copy` entry
//      carries a recorded `sha256` (a string for a file, one hash per member for a
//      directory), and the local file must hash to it. Existence alone was close to no
//      check for these: 19 of 20 skills, last version's SPEC.md, or a guard with its
//      policy block deleted all reported drift 0. A `merge` entry cannot be hashed - it is
//      adapted on purpose - so it may declare `requiredKeys` naming what must survive the
//      merge (JSON and YAML block mappings), because "the file exists" is worthless when
//      the point of the entry is a block inside it.
//   2. Manifest (or fallback skeleton): required files/altPaths exist; required sections
//      are present in their files; static guards pass. Each entry may carry a profile
//      (core|scale, ADR-011) - core is whatever keeps knowledge alive, scale is whatever
//      coordinates people. --profile core checks core only; --profile scale checks everything;
//      no flag = the manifest copy's "profile" field, then scale. solo/team are
//      accepted silently as deprecated aliases
//      (solo -> core, team -> scale). An entry with no profile counts as core, so
//      manifests from before ADR-011 still check in full either way.
//   3. Stray transition skills (ADR-009): align-to-standards, onboard-repo, modernize,
//      greenfield-start never ship in a consuming repo. One found under .claude/skills/
//      is a hand-copy mistake, flagged as a warning - it does not add to drift.
//
// Usage:
//   node scripts/self-verify.mjs                  # gate: exit 1 on any failure
//   node scripts/self-verify.mjs --version 1.0.13  # also assert the record equals a target
//   node scripts/self-verify.mjs --warn           # report only, always exit 0
//   node scripts/self-verify.mjs --profile core   # core-profile entries only (ADR-011);
//                                                 # without the flag, the repo's manifest
//                                                 # copy's top-level "profile" field is the
//                                                 # default, then scale (= everything)
//   node scripts/self-verify.mjs --skeleton       # verify the shipped tree itself: skip the
//                                                 # version pin, guards, and fill-from-repo

//     is absent is SKIPPED below (optional guards legitimately are not installed), so

//     `kind: "content"` on the same path IS allowed: a repo may record that it changed a
//     guard, because the guard still has to run and pass.
//   - Every exception carries a reason. "Recorded deviation" with nothing recorded is not
