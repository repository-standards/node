// elicitation-provenance - the repo says how each answer was arrived at, and a deferred
// answer is not allowed to evaporate.
//
// The hook next door (.claude/hooks/elicitation-guard.mjs) refuses a write until its
// question fired. What it cannot see is what happened to the answer: a question asked and
// then quietly overridden looks identical to one asked and honoured. So the states live in
// one ledger a reviewer reads in a single pass - docs/adoption-provenance.md - instead of
// as frontmatter on every artifact, where nobody compares them.
//
// What it enforces:
//   1. Every required point has a row. A point with no row is not "fine", it is unrecorded.
//   2. The state is one the point allows. `inferred` is rejected wherever the answer is a
//      preference rather than a fact about the code - that is the whole distinction.
//   3. `provisional` names a backlog row, and that row exists. This is the one that matters:
//      "the agent suggested, the owner will check later" is a promise, and an unkept promise
//      here reads exactly like a settled decision six months on.
//   4. `human` names who and when. Unverifiable here on purpose - the transcript checker is
//      what tests that claim, and a gate that pretends to verify it would be worse than one
//      that says it cannot.
//   5. `pending` is legal until the point is REACHED, and reaching it is a fact about the
//      tree rather than a flag: the point gates a path where the adoption has now written
//      something. Something was written where the question belonged, so it was either asked
//      or skipped, and `pending` is false either way.
//
//      Two spellings of that rule were tried and both were red on arrival, which is the
//      failure mode worth naming: a guard that fails the day it lands teaches people to
//      delete it. First, pending fails once `.standards-version` exists - but that file is
//      written at align time, before a single question has been put to anyone. Then, pending
//      fails once a gated path holds any non-template file - but a brownfield repository
//      arrives holding decision records, a PRODUCT.md and specs it wrote years before it had
//      heard of this standard, and its own history is not evidence that anybody was asked.
//
//      So reaching is scoped to what the adoption itself wrote: git separates the two, at the
//      commit that introduced the standard, plus everything not yet committed. Where that
//      boundary cannot be drawn - no git work tree - the check says so out loud and stands
//      down. A silent skip reads in the output exactly like a pass.
//
//      One edge, stated rather than hidden: a point that gates no path - a rename, a phase
//      boundary - can never be reached here, and the static check and human review carry
//      those. Everything else is read: an artifact that never shipped is the adopter's, a
//      file meant to stay verbatim is compared to its hash, and a fill-from-repo slot counts
//      as untouched only while it still holds the placeholders it shipped with.
//
// A repo with no ledger at all fails rather than passes. Absence of the record is the
// state this whole mechanism exists to stop being invisible.
