# What ships, and what to do with it

An adopting repository receives these paths. The reference copy of each lives in
[`starter/`](starter/README.md), and the per-entry migration notes - what to do when you
already have your own - are in [adapting](ADAPTING.md).

Two words carry the meaning in the last column. **Copy as-is** means the file is the
decision; changing it is deviating, and deviating is fine if you record it. **Merge into
yours** means the substance is a block inside the file, not the whole file: your globs,
your job names, your paths stay yours.

| Path | What it is | How to take it |
|---|---|---|
| `.nvmrc` | the Node version pin - one runtime, no drift between machines | copy as-is &middot; required |
| `biome.json` | lint + format, one tool - the reference copy encodes the strictness the picks assume | merge into yours &middot; required |
| `tsconfig.base.json` | strict TypeScript base every package extends | merge into yours &middot; required |
| `pnpm-workspace.yaml` | workspace globs + the supply-chain policy (release-age cooldown, allowed build scripts, save-exact) - the policy block is the point | merge into yours &middot; required |
| `vitest.config.ts` | unit and integration tiers as separate Vitest projects | merge into yours &middot; required |
| `playwright.config.ts` | the e2e tier - real browser journeys against the running app | merge into yours &middot; optional |
| `docker-compose.test.yml` | ephemeral real dependencies for integration/e2e - not mocks | copy as-is &middot; optional |
| `perf/` | local Lighthouse perf-budget runner - report-only, committed baseline + dated history, no external upload; edit config.mjs routes | copy as-is &middot; optional |
| `scripts/perf-budget.sh` | local perf env prep (seed/build/start) - copy, then adapt its SEED/BUILD/START hooks to your stack | copy as-is &middot; optional |
| `renovate.json` | dependency updates as reviewed diffs, riding the same 7-day cooldown | merge into yours &middot; optional |
| `.github/workflows/ci.yml` | hardened least-privilege CI template | merge into yours &middot; optional |
| `.github/workflows/e2e.yml` | the e2e tier in CI, against the docker test stack | merge into yours &middot; optional |

## What gets checked

The same engine that verifies the standard verifies this layer, and reports one drift
number across both. These are what it runs here:

| Runs | Proves |
|---|---|
| `pnpm check:all` | format + types + lint green - the stack's own quality gate counted in the same drift number |

## What is not here

No Dockerfile and no deploy target. That is the least portable decision a repository makes,
and a starter that faked one would boot on nothing. The shape ships instead - standalone
output, plain node process, stdout logging, env-only config - and the target is a decision
you record. [The decisions](DECISIONS.md) says what that record has to cover.
