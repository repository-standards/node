## Conventions

### Working language

Language is a **configuration**, not a constraint - an AI reads whatever you choose, so
decide per artifact and state it in `AGENTS.md`. Default: **English** (widest collaboration,
best ecosystem fit), but any team may pick its own - a German team writing German docs and
English commits is a first-class setup, not a workaround.

| Artifact | Recommended | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Code identifiers (names, public APIs) | English | interop with libraries and tooling |
| Code comments | repo's choice | |
| Docs, specs, decision records | repo's choice | one language per artifact type |
| Commit messages, PR text | English | recommended |
| User-facing copy | the persona's language | driven by the audience, not the team |
| Strings a guard greps for | never translated | see below - they are syntax, not prose |

**What a script reads is syntax, and syntax stays as written** in a spec in any language:
the open-marker family (`[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ...]`, `[NEEDS DECISION: ...]`,
`[NEEDS INPUT: ...]`, `[NEEDS ASSET: ...]`), the headings the clarify gate looks for
(`## Clarifications`, `## Open questions`), the fields the guards read (`**Status:**`,
`**Serves:**`, `**Spec tier:**`) and intent ids with their `blocked:<id>` status. The text
*inside* a marker is prose and belongs in your language. Translating the syntax does not
make a check speak your language, it makes the check find nothing and report PASS - which
is why the clarify gate fails on a marker-shaped token it does not recognise.

Pick once, record it in `AGENTS.md`, and keep it consistent within an artifact type.
The reasoning behind the default, the cases where your own language wins, and how to draw
the boundary when a repo carries more than one: the standard's
[working-language guide](https://github.com/repository-standards/core/blob/main/docs/method/working-language.md).

### Commits and PRs

- Conventional Commits: `type(scope): TICKET-123 imperative summary`. The ticket
  key goes after the colon, never `(TICKET-123)` at the end.
- No AI/tool attribution in commits or PR text - no `Co-Authored-By: Claude ...`,
  `Generated with ...`, `Made-with: Cursor`, emoji trailers. They read as if a
  person wrote them.
- One commit = one logical change. Small, focused PRs.

### Branch and history (R23)

`main` reads as a sequence of finished units of work - one per PR, each one
buildable, each one revertable. Four rules get you there:

- **Branch off `main`; base every PR on `main`** - never on another open PR's
  branch. A base that gets rewritten when it lands strands its children's commits.
  If work truly must build on unmerged work, land the parent first, or carry the
  whole sequence in one PR as ordered commits.
- **Update by rebase, never by back-merge.** `git rebase main` (or the platform's
  "update with rebase"); never `git merge main` into your branch. A back-merge
  drags unrelated work into your branch, so no commit in it is testable on its
  own, and it leaves `main` a braid nobody can read afterwards.
- **Keep rebasing until the branch reads well, then rebase-merge.** Every commit
  that lands is complete on its own: it builds, it is reviewed, it can be reverted
  alone. Squash the wip/fixup noise before review (`git rebase -i`), not after.
  This bar is the price of rebase-merge - a repo that will not hold it uses
  squash-merge and records that in its branching ADR. One honest commit beats five
  dishonest ones.
- **Rewrite only what is yours.** `--force-with-lease` on your own branch is
  routine. A branch someone else has pulled, or based work on, is frozen: fix it
  forward. This is the one hard stop in the list - rewriting shared history
  destroys other people's work.

**If this repo maintains more than one release line** - a `3.x` branch still taking
security fixes while `main` moves on - read the first rule as *base every PR on the
branch it will merge into*, and the other three as binding that line exactly as they
bind `main`: update by rebasing onto it, never back-merge it, never rewrite it. Land
the fix on `main` **first**, then open one PR per supported line (a cherry-pick,
adapted where the code diverged), and write that line's changelog entry under its own
`## Unreleased` heading. Which lines are supported, and until when, belongs in the
branching decision where a contributor will find it - a line nobody knows is supported
is a line that silently regresses. What is never a legal base is another open pull
request's branch, whatever it is named
([ADR-035](https://github.com/repository-standards/core/blob/main/docs/decision-records/ADR-035-maintained-release-lines-are-integration-targets.md)).

**If review does not happen on the git host** - a mailing-list patch series, a
Gerrit change - the four rules bind to whatever this repo reviews as one unit,
and the branching ADR names it. Without that name, "one per PR" has no referent
here and the section reads as somebody else's workflow.

Turn on the platform's linear-history protection so the rule is enforced, not
remembered, and set the merge button to the method this repo recorded. Why this
shape, what it costs, and when squash or a merge commit is the better pick:

### Database schema (R24)

If this repo owns a database, its schema lives here twice and the two copies are
one pair:

- **`database/schema/` holds executable DDL** - enough to rebuild the database
  from a checkout alone. That is the disaster-recovery copy and the thing a
  reviewer reads. Migrations are the delta, not the current state.
- **A typed, documented definition in this stack's idiom** (Zod, Pydantic, ...) is
  what every read and write path goes through. Do not restate row shapes inline.
- **They are 1:1, and it is checked.** Every table, column, constraint and enum in
  one is in the other, and a change to either lands in the same PR as the change to
  the other. Each file names its counterpart in a `pair: <path>` comment;
  `node scripts/schema-pair.mjs` resolves that edge both ways and fails when a name
  the DDL defines is missing from the twin (`self-verify` runs it). Either side may
  be generated where the generator does not quietly drop what DDL can express.
- **An agent never applies a schema change to a remote database.** Prepare the
  reviewed `.sql` file and hand it to a human (R19).

Why two copies rather than one generated source:

### Writing

- ASCII hyphen `-` only, everywhere (prose, docs, UI copy, commits, PRs). Never
  the em dash `—` or en dash `–`.
- **A fact has one home (R4).** A count, a version, a path or a command belongs in
  one file; everywhere else links to it. If it genuinely has to be restated, declare
  the restatement in `docs/facts.json` (shape: [`facts.example.json`](facts.example.json)) - source and claim - and
  `node scripts/facts-check.mjs` fails when they disagree. Undeclared restatements
  rot: "twenty rules" outlived the twenty-first by weeks.

### Where rules live (ADR-012)

**In-repo instructions are the source of truth.** Every rule about working in this
repo lives in the repo, at its taxonomy home: conventions here / `AGENTS.md`,
contribution mechanics in `CONTRIBUTING`, behavior in specs, decisions in records
(the process itself is the standard's
[ways of working](https://github.com/repository-standards/core/blob/main/docs/method/ways-of-working.md),
adopted by reference from the living standard - always latest; unsure which of these a
given rule or fork is,
[`taxonomy.md`](https://github.com/repository-standards/core/blob/main/docs/method/taxonomy.md)
is the map, and the forks themselves are catalogued in
[`checklist.md`](https://github.com/repository-standards/core/blob/main/docs/method/checklist.md)).
Personal memory, `~/.claude`-style global configs, and chat may
*point* at repo rules - they must never *hold* them. A rule that exists only outside
the repo is treated as **missing**; finding one is a defect, fixed by landing the rule
at its home. "It's in my memory" is not a location.

### Agent guards

The hooks under `.claude/hooks/` refuse an action before the tool runs. Two properties, and
the second is the one that gets forgotten:

- They **fail closed**, and so does the wiring that reaches them. A hook that cannot load its
  library, or whose dependency is missing, denies. The three run behind `guards.sh`, which
  denies when any of them is missing, unreadable or exits without a verdict, and
  `settings.json` denies when `guards.sh` itself cannot be run - a hook that exits 127 with
  empty stdout is a command that ran unchecked.
- They are **tested**. A guard prints only when it refuses, so a broken one is silent: it
  stops protecting and nothing says so. `bash scripts/verifyAgentGuards.sh` exists for exactly
  that reason - run it after any change under `.claude/hooks/`.

A guard that blocks legitimate work gets disabled, and a disabled guard protects nothing, so
anything slow, anything needing the network to decide, and anything prone to a false refusal
does not belong there.
